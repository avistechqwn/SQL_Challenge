Employee_SQL_Challenge

BACKGROUND:
As a data engineer at a fictional company, the first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

For this project, one will design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. This tasks includes performing data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.
